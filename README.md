# InterviewPreparation
> The goal here is to document the process followed by me and make sure that if someone totally new to software interview process can follow along and be prepared for the toughest interviews out there.

## Steps Intended to be Followed

- Go through one data structures and algorithms tutorial first.
- While going through it, as and when a data structure is introduced, understand it as an abstract structure, understand and research how to best implement it. Implement the basic methods needed for the structure to function well.
- When the algorithm part is encountered, use the data structure defined and implement the algorithm.
- After finishing one tutorial like this, go for the hackerrank challenges.
- After finishing hackerrank challenges, go through one more tutorial and back the understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- After finishing that, go through Geeks for Geeks and Cracking the Coding Interview.
- Go through any tutorial that is left (If any)
- Then go ahead and apply. And have fun!
